Portfolio Website
==============

If your looking to showcase your work, this is perfect for you, but please make sure to customize it and make it your own, after all, it is supposed to be _your work_, right?

==============

``` 
--> make sure to replace all of the 'your name' text with your name
--> on the 'about me' page have selections that relate to you
--> put real images where the "?" placeholders are in the portfolio
--> the 'home' page is meant to be a blog
--> change the <title> to whatever you like </title>
--> let me know about issues
```

=============

Most (just about all) of the code found on this page was created by Codrops. I just patched a few of their demos together. Make sure to check them out on [GitHub](http://github.com/codrops) and [Online](http://tympanus.net/codrops).
